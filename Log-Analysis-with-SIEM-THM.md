Overview

This project documents my hands-on experience with the TryHackMe Log Analysis with SIEM lab. The goal of this lab was to build foundational SOC skills by analyzing multiple types of logs and using a SIEM platform to detect and investigate suspicious activity.

Objectives

Understand the role of SIEM in a SOC environment.

Analyze Linux, Windows, and Web Application logs.

Use Splunk queries to triage security events.

Identify suspicious activity and potential attacks.

Sub-Labs Completed

1. Cyber Kill Chain

Learned the stages of the Cyber Kill Chain model.

Mapped attacker activity to different phases such as reconnaissance, exploitation, and persistence.

2. Windows Logging for SOC

Analyzed Windows event logs.

Identified authentication events and suspicious process activity.

Understood how Windows logs support investigations.

3. Introduction to SIEM

Explored SIEM dashboards and log sources.

Learned how logs are ingested and correlated.

Used filters and searches to locate events.

4. SOC Level 1 Alert Triage

Reviewed security alerts in a SIEM interface.

Classified alerts as true positives or false positives.

Investigated brute-force and authentication-based alerts.

Tools Used

TryHackMe Lab Environment.

Splunk SIEM Interface.

Key Skills Gained

Log analysis (Linux, Windows, Web).

Alert triage.

Writing and modifying SIEM queries.

Understanding attacker behavior using the Cyber Kill Chain.

Key Takeaways

This lab strengthened my understanding of how SOC analysts investigate logs and respond to alerts using a SIEM platform. It also improved my confidence in navigating Splunk and correlating events across different log sources.
